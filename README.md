# wdcd_replication
This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the results in "What Does Codetermination Do?" (Jäger, Noy, and Schoefer, 2021, ILR Review), with the exception of the European Company Survey data (which are not publicly available, but can be downloaded with a license).

## INSTRUCTIONS
- Download the raw data files in the folder "Raw Data", and save them in a folder named "Raw Data"
- Download the .do files in the folder "State Code", and save them in a folder named "Stata Code"
- Download the .ado files in the folder "Ado", and save them in a folder named "Ado"
- Download "Master File.do", and update the working directory and paths at the top of the document to match your computer
- Run "Master File.do"

## EXPLANATION

The Raw Data folder contains the following files:
- "World_Countries.shp" and "World_Countries.dbf" (standard shape files for Stata's
	'spmap' command)
- "World Bank - annual population.csv" and "World Bank - pct of population who are working age.csv",
	which are datasets at the country-year level from the World Bank that enable us
	to calculate the number of working-age people in each country-year in our data 
	(information which we use to normalize certain outcome variables). The datasets are
	downloaded from the following URL: https://data.oecd.org/pop/population.htm#indicator-chart
- "cbr_data.xlsx", which is the dataset from the CBR Labor Regulation Index
	compiled by Adams, Bishop, and Deakin (2016). This dataset is downloaded from
	the following URL: https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256566
- Several Excel files named "ILO_COUNTRYNAME.xlsx", which contain data on strike
	intensity at the country-year level (and population, which we use to fill in years
	prior to 1960, which is when the World Bank population data start). These data
	are sourced from International Labour Organization Yearbooks; they are compiled
	by Sjaak van der Velden, whom we thank, and the full source dataset is available for download
	at the following URL: https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataverse/Global
- Several .txt files named "AMECOnum.txt", which contain data on aggregate 
	economic outcomes from the European Commission's AMECO database. They are
	available for download at the following URL: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/macro-economic-database-ameco/download-annual-data-set-macro-economic-database-ameco_en
- "WEF labor relations.xlsx" presents average responses at the country-year level 
	to a question in the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey, about
	the cooperativeness of labor relations. The data are available since 2007.
	The source file, "WEF labor relations source file.xlsx", can be downloaded
	from the following URL: http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/competitiveness-dataset-xls/
- "OECD Institutions Data.xlsx", which contains historical data at the country-year
	level on works council powers, union density, and centralization in collective bargaining.
	The data are drawn from the OECD/IAIS ICTWSS dataset, accessible at the following
	URL: https://www.oecd.org/employment/ictwss-database.htm
- The code additionally requires two European Company Survey files, named "ecs13_management.dta" and "ecs19_management.dta", which are not publicly available but 	can be downloaded with a registered account through the UK Data Service, URL: https://ukdataservice.ac.uk
	
The comments in "Master File.do" explains the functions performed by each .do file. The figures in the paper are generated by the following files:
- Figure 2 is generated by "OECD and CBR Institutions data cleaning and analysis.do"
- Figure 3, Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 4, and Appendix Figures A.3-A.14, are generated by "Event-study analyses.do"
- Figure 4 Panel (c) is generated by "WEF labor relations cross-sectional analysis.do"
- Figure 5, and Appendix Figure A.15, are generated by "ECS data cleaning and analysis.do"
- Appendix Figures A.1 and A.2 are generated by "CBR Maps.do"
- Appendix Figure B.1 is generated by "List of codetermination reforms.do"
- Appendix Figure B.2 is generated by "ILO strikes data cleaning.do"
- Appendix Figure B.3 is generated by "WEF labor relations cross-sectional analysis.do"

## NOTES
- Running the code requires installation of the following (possibly non-exhaustive) list of Stata packages: xls2data, reghdfe, synth, boottest, spmap, shp2dta, binscatter, . The code also uses did_imputation.ado and event_plot.ado, which are available in the "Ado Files" folder.
- In "World Bank population data.do", one of the variables is sometimes read in as "ïlocation" and sometimes read in as "location", depending on the computer. If the code crashes at this file, it's likely because of this issue; adjust "location" or "ïlocation" throughout the file appropriately.
