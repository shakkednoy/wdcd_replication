# wdcd_replication
This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the results in "What Does Codetermination Do?" (JÃ¤ger, Noy, and Schoefer, 2021, ILR Review), with the exception of the European Company Survey data (which are not publicly available, but can be downloaded with a license).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Download the raw data files in the folder "Raw Data", and save them in a folder named "Raw Data"
- Download the .do files in the folder "State Code", and save them in a folder named "Stata Code"
- Download "Master File.do", and update the working directory and paths at the top of the document to match your computer
- Run "Master File.do"

EXPLANATION:

The Raw Data folder contains the following files:
- "World_Countries.shp" and "World_Countries.dbf" (standard shape files for Stata's
	'spmap' command)
- "World Bank - annual population.csv" and "World Bank - pct of population who are working age.csv",
	which are datasets at the country-year level from the World Bank that enable us
	to calculate the number of working-age people in each country-year in our data 
	(information which we use to normalize certain outcome variables). The datasets are
	downloaded from the following URL: https://data.oecd.org/pop/population.htm#indicator-chart
- "cbr_data.xlsx", which is the dataset from the CBR Labor Regulation Index
	compiled by Adams, Bishop, and Deakin (2016). This dataset is downloaded from
	the following URL: https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256566
